# Chapter 2: Small Worlds and Large Worlds

Statistical modeling exists dualistically, in a **small world** (contained by
the model's inherent logic) and a **big world** (the context in which the model
will live).

In the *small world*, it is important to make sure the model is valid,
consistent, and well-behaved.

The *large world* is the broader context in which the finalized model will
exist. It is important to note that the statistical model *always*
underrepresents the full context of the *large world*. Out of sample data
emerge, and a model's logical inconsistencies can surface.

Adapting to the *large world* is a straightforward process, for nature.
For Bayesian models, the process is much more complex. It is difficult to beat
natural heuristics once a model identifies what to look for.

Chapter 2 focuses on the *small world*.

## 2.1: The garden of forking data

Bayesian analysis lends itself to continually exploring alternatives. In this
sense, Bayesian analysis creates a series of data "forks" in its quest to
deduce.

## 2.2: Building a model

Development of a Bayesian model is best done cyclically:

1. Create a **data story**
2. Update
3. Evaluate
4. Repeat

### 2.2.1: A data story

The first step is to develop a story, built on either associations or
causality, about the data, particularly its variation. *Data stories* involve
descriptions of the *large world*, as well as the *small world* sampling
process. This story is then put into formal terms of probability.

Recall that any model may map back to multiple stories. Thus, model
success does not necessarily imply confirmation of the story.

### 2.2.2: Bayesian updating

You create a Bayesian model with an initial estimate, your **prior**. Then, as
you sample data, your model learns from the new data, *updating* itself.

### 2.2.3: Evaluate

The nature of Bayesian models guarantees that, within the *small world*, the
model will achieve perfect inference. This means that extra care must be taken
to evaluate the model within the *large world*, where *small world* success
does not necessarily translate.

Remember that a model's assumptions are never 100% correct. Failure to disprove
a model is therefore an error of science, not a sign of success.

## 2.3: Components of the model

### 2.3.1: Variables

In the context of Bayesian models, **variables** refer to either *observable*
**data** or *unobservable* **parameters**.

### 2.3.2: Definitions

The **definitions** of the relationships among *variables* constitute a
**model**.

#### 2.3.2.1: Observed variables

To "count" an **observed variable**, we assign it a probability distribution,
known as a **likelihood**.

#### 2.3.2.2: Unobserved variables
