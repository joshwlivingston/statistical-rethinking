# Chapter 1: The Golem of Prague

## 1.1: Statistical Golems

- Scientistis frequently construct and use "statistical golems" - tools that
  know their own procedure, but have no inherent wisdom.
  - p-values, stat tests, etc
- Classical statistical tools may not be adaptable to all modern research
  scenarios.
- The golems are often *associative* rather than *causal*, leading to misuse.

## 1.2: Statistical Rethinking

- The classic approach is to use a "flow-chart" to determine the statistical
  procedure to use. However, this can lead to battles over picking the
  "correct" test.
- We also face epistemological issues, realized as conflation between 
  causation and hypothesis falsification.
  - Karl Popper's *The Myth of the Framework* (1996), his last book, covers 
    this topic.
- McElreath posits that *"deductive falsification is impossible"*, given that:
  - Hypotheses are not models. So, falsifiying the hypothesis does not 
    falsify the model.
  - Measurement can invalidate models. If the measurement is wrong, 
    falsification is not possible.
  - Note that null hypothesis signficance testing (NHST) attempts to falsify 
    the *null hypothesis*, not the actual research hypothesis.
